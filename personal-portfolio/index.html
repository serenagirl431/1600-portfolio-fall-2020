                        <li> I like learning about the different ways that people use code to create the things that we
                            interact with every day.</li>
                        <li>I like that web dev mixes computers and art.</li>
                        <li>There are a lot of job openings in Web Dev.</li>
                        <li>The technology is always advancing, and there are always more skills to learn</li>
                        <li>I think it's fun to make new things.</li>

                <h5>HTML 5</h5>
                <p class="final-paragraph">I am most excited to learn more about HTML 5. I’m not very familiar with any
                    of the other things that we will be learning this semester. I have some experience with HTML 5 from
                    other classes, and I’ve only had good experiences so far. I really like expanding on the knowledge
                    that I already have, as opposed to learning a brand new language like Javascript. It’s fun to figure
                    out how to accomplish goals with HTML that I didn’t know how to do before. It’s a very satisfying
                    feeling to watch your skills advance.
